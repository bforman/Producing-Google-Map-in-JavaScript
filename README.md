# Tkinter-Visual
This research module highlights my progress in implementing a visual for the infinite playlist project

#Description
I have been studying Dr. Parry's infinite player code and planning a visual to produce for it. I have an inquiry report outlining Tkinter, the module I will use to produce the visual. Once the visual itself is laid out there will be difficult tasks presented such as: syncing the visual with the plethora of branch options that could exist for a song, making sure the ghost paths line up correctly, and making sure that when the visual animates it does so smoothly. This research module highlights my progress in that process and shows how I used the Tkinter module to produce a preliminary layout for the visual.

#The idea
As an end product I envision a visual that utilizes two rectangle shapes to symbolize: the current track being played, as well as a potential track to make branches to.
